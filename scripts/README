this directory contains scripts to generate
versioning and build number information for
the fpga _and_ for the C code which uses the
fpga routines.

except for mkhdr.sh, these scripts are to
be executed from the directory of module that
is being compiled.

getbld.sh: 
	retrieve the current build number

getfpga.sh: 
	retrieve the current fpga type.

getver.sh: 
	retrieve the version number of the module

mkhdr.sh: 
	create a C header file

mkmif.sh: 
	create the .mif file (memory image file)

newbld.sh: 
	increment the build number

sdata.txt: 
	the module <-> index file (delimit with a single space)

tdata.txt: 
	the fpga types index file (delimit with a single space)
