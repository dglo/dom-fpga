this directory contains scripts to generate
versioning and build number information for
the fpga _and_ for the C code which uses the
fpga routines.

except for mkhdr.sh, these scripts are to
be executed from the directory of module that
is being compiled.

getbld.sh: 
	retrieve the current build number

getfpga.sh: 
	retrieve the current fpga type.
	we use the current working directory to determine
	which of the fpga types to use.  make sure to
	name the directories in such a way as that they
	will be picked up...

getver.sh: 
	retrieve the version number of the module.
	we look in the current directory for the file
	given on the command line as the first arg to
	this script.  if it doesn't exist, we keep looking
	in common directories until we find it...

mkhdr.sh: 
	create a C header file

mkmif.sh: 
	create the .mif file (memory image file)

newbld.sh: 
	increment the build number

sdata.txt: 
	the module <-> index file (delimit with a single space)

tdata.txt: 
	the fpga types index file (delimit with a single space)
